Hello this is my first personal project so if there are any stupid mistakes forgive me
any help or suggestions would be well appreciated! This app allows you to find and
book flights to various destinations. It copies the look of PAL with clean calendar
choices and a visual seat picker. It also features an admin panel that is only
accessible if you have an account.

This app still has many bugs and there are many features I would like to add but
current circumstances prevent me from doing so and I think this is a good proof
of concept.

### `Run npm install` to run this app

### `npm start` to start the app
